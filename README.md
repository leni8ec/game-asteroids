> The goal of this project is to show the possible structure of the project in
> Unity as simply as possible, <u>without any external dependencies</u>.
>
> Simple custom implementations of the:
> - dependency container
> - abstractions for factories, spawners and pools
> - elementary Reactive Properties
>
> The main focus is on <u>reducing the boilerplate code</u>.
> So it may seem that there are not enough abstractions
> (for example, the principle of Dependency Inversion is not applied everywhere),
> this is done intentionally, until those abstractions are really required
> (architecturally, they are supported)

### ‚úÖ Architecture (design patterns)

- **[MVP (SC)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/SupervisingPresenter.html)** - as a **Core** architectural basis (SC - supervising controller)
- **[MVP (PV)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html)** - as a **GUI** architectural basis (PV - passive view)
- **Data** (`state`, `config`) is split from **Logic** (`systems`)
- **Reactive properties** - simple realization
- **IoC, DI** - dependency injection
- **Object Pool** - spawn and reuse entities
- **Factory Method** - create new entities (used with Pool)
- **Commands (signals)** - handle input
- **Adapters** - used for Unity components (`camera`, `audio`)

### üî≤ Unity

- **Scriptable objects** (for configs)
- **Input system**

### ‚û°Ô∏è Todo

- Event System - _purpose ?_
- Save game state - repositories usage
- Unit-tests - simple usages of Unity Test Framework
